| September 11 |  12:45-1:45   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                In class, I began thinking about the problem and then started writing code based on how I initially wanted to solve the problem. I tried to use a breadth first search, treating every "move" as a highway. I also used the whiteboard to help me think out an example case. |
| September 11 |  4:30-6:15pm  | I continued coding and was troubleshooting my initial solution. I also used a test case to help see what the graph actually looked like. Finally, I fixed a few of the issues that exist. One big problem was trying to grab a city that I haven't visited yet in order to jump to the next cluster. I ended up just doing a loop through every city and grabbing the first one that hadn't been visited. Extremely inefficient but it worked, passing 5 our of 6 test cases (other one timed out I think). |

To be honest, it is much more simple than my original solution, and much more efficient as well. I now have a few bugs that I need to fix, as the answers are currently wrong. I am still not sure if the Union Find map is being created incorrectly, or the arithmatic expression to get total cost is wrong. |

The first change was my while loop, as my original statement compared the node value to -1 instead of the value assigned to that node. It was kind of a typo on my part because that is what I meant to write. After that change, the code worked great and passed every test case! |
