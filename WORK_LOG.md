I tried to use a breadth first search, treating every "move" as a highway. I also used the whiteboard to help me think out an example case. |
| September 11 |   5-6pm    | I continued coding and was troubleshooting my initial solution. I also used a test case to help see what the graph actually looked like. Finally, I fixed a few of the issues that exist. One big problem was trying to grab a city that I haven't visited yet in order to jump to the next cluster. I ended up just doing a loop through every city and grabbing the first one that hadn't been visited. Extremely inefficient but it worked, passing 5 our of 6 test cases (other one timed out I think).  |
