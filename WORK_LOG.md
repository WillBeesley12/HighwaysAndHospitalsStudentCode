| September 11  |    12:45-1:45    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                In class, I began thinking about the problem and then started writing code based on how I initially wanted to solve the problem. I tried to use a breadth first search, treating every "move" as a highway. I also used the whiteboard to help me think out an example case. |
| September 11  |   4:30-6:15pm    | I continued coding and was troubleshooting my initial solution. I also used a test case to help see what the graph actually looked like. Finally, I fixed a few of the issues that exist. One big problem was trying to grab a city that I haven't visited yet in order to jump to the next cluster. I ended up just doing a loop through every city and grabbing the first one that hadn't been visited. Extremely inefficient but it worked, passing 5 our of 6 test cases (other one timed out I think). |
| September 15  |  3:30 - 4:15pm   |                                                                                                                                      I implemented the Union - Find algorithm into my code. To be honest, it is much more simple than my original solution, and much more efficient as well. I now have a few bugs that I need to fix, as the answers are currently wrong. I am still not sure if the Union Find map is being created incorrectly, or the arithmatic expression to get total cost is wrong. |
| September 15  |  4:15 - 4:35pm   |                                                                                                                                                           I debugged a little bit and made only one change to the code. The first change was my while loop, as my original statement compared the node value to -1 instead of the value assigned to that node. It was kind of a typo on my part because that is what I meant to write. After that change, the code worked great and passed every test case! |
| September 18  | 12:40 - 1:45 pm  |                                                                                                                                                           Since my unionfind algorithm started to work, I began to implement the weight balancing and also the path compression. It took a long time to really understand the algorithms and how it would fit into my code, and I also had a very large amount of errors once I implemented both of them. I will now have to spend a lot of time debugging. |
| September 19  | 10:30 to 11:20am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I continued debugging. I found a bunch of errors, a lot of times with the wrong signs when I forgot to flip them because the order uses negative numbers. Now it is mainly working for most tests, but it still has errors for 2 and an out of bounds index for the last case.  |
